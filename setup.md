Chess Analysis Google Apps Script Project Summary
Project Overview
A Google Apps Script system that automatically fetches Chess.com game data via API, processes it for comprehensive analysis, and organizes it across multiple Google Sheets with smart incremental updates and full recalculation capabilities.
Core Requirements

Pull monthly chess game archives from Chess.com API
Perform extensive data manipulation and analysis on each game
Structure data for both incremental updates and full recalculations
Separate historical (static) data from current (dynamic) data
Combine all data for comprehensive analysis
Handle large datasets efficiently

Architecture
Google Sheets Structure
Chess_Analysis_Master Workbook:
├── Config_Control (settings, static flags, parameters)
├── API_Status (rate limits, errors, fetch times)
├── Processing_Log (execution history)
├── Data_Quality_Report (validation results)
├── Monthly Sheets (2024_12, 2024_11, etc.) - raw + processed data
├── Combined_Games (aggregated data)
├── Player_Stats (derived statistics)
├── Opening_Analysis (opening performance)
├── Time_Analysis (time management patterns)
└── Advanced_Metrics (complex calculations)
Google Apps Script Files

Key Features
Processing Modes

Incremental (Daily): Update only recent games, keep historical data static
Full Current Month (Weekly): Reprocess entire current month
Complete Rebuild (On-demand): Recalculate everything when code changes

Data Analysis

Game metrics: move count, duration, accuracy, mistakes, blunders
Performance analysis: rating changes, win probability, time pressure
Strategic analysis: opening success, endgame performance
Advanced metrics: rating performance, custom calculations

Smart Data Management

Monthly sheets become "static" after processing to avoid recomputation
Configuration-driven processing with customizable parameters
Rate limiting and error handling for Chess.com API
Data validation and quality monitoring
Automated triggers for scheduled updates

Scalability Features

Handles large datasets by processing monthly chunks
Incremental updates minimize API calls and processing time
Static flagging prevents unnecessary recalculation of historical data
Modular code structure allows easy feature additions

Technical Approach

Object-oriented JavaScript classes for clean code organization
Configuration-driven system stored in dedicated sheets
Comprehensive error handling and logging
API rate limiting compliance (Chess.com limits)
Data validation and anomaly detection
Automated scheduling via Google Apps Script triggers

Benefits

Efficient processing of large historical chess datasets
Flexible recalculation options for code evolution
Comprehensive game analysis beyond basic statistics
Scalable architecture that grows with data volume
Automated operation with manual override capabilities
